# voiceChanger
Music Programming Project


To Use the Voice Changer app, you will need to grant the app access to your device's microphone.
Once this is done you will hear audio playing back to you.
To use the filters, press the "Turn filter on" button.
Adjust the effect of the filters using the sliders.
To generate a .wav file for you to download, press the microphone to begin recording.
Press the microphone a second time to complete your recording and you will notice that the Save button is now available.
Pressing the Save button will begin the download.

**Please Note: We are in Beta testing mode and there are a few problems.
1. Turning the filter off after turning it on may cause the spectrogram to fail to work
2. On some browsers, the filters won't work until you first adjust the Quality filter
